I worked on a detailed sales analysis project for a fictional coffee shop business using Microsoft Excel, leveraging a large dataset consisting of over 149,000 transactions and 21 data fields. The objective was to extract actionable insights to help improve sales performance and customer experience.

🔍 Key Areas Explored:
Sales trends by date, time, and location

Performance of different product categories and items

Revenue contribution by store branch and sales channel

Top customers and their buying patterns

Insights on payment methods, discounts, and order types

🛠 Tools & Techniques Used:
Data cleaning using Excel filters and text functions

PivotTables and PivotCharts for dynamic summaries

Conditional formatting to highlight key metrics

Advanced formulas like VLOOKUP, IF, SUMIFS, and TEXT

Created interactive dashboards using slicers and drop-down filters

📈 Insights Discovered:
Highest sales occurred during weekends and morning hours

Coffee and pastries were the most popular product categories

Branch B consistently outperformed others in revenue and volume

Mobile payments showed an upward trend in customer preference

This project helped me sharpen my Excel skills for real-world data analysis and dashboarding. It also strengthened my ability to derive business insights from raw data.

I’m proud to have worked with such a large dataset and developed a solution that could support strategic decisions for a coffee shop business.
